# My future portfolio!

## Hi to whoever reading this, this is my portfolio and I did a lot of effort doing this, I thought I will only use small lines of codes but I ended up having more lines.

### I created this because it will be my reference to my future job application, I will keep on updating it and hopefully I can use front-end frameworks to make this more beautiful.

### This portfolio have sections, about me, my works during the bootcamp, my resume, and my contact information, just click each navigations to be directed to the sections you clicked. This is my second portfolio because I deleted the old one and hopefully you will like it. I tried my best to make my code clean!



# To whoever's reading this Thank you so much for your time ðŸ˜€
